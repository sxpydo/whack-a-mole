# whack-a-mole
Exploring Vanilla JavaScript by following a tutorial of making the grid-based game from Ania Kubów on youtube with adding my own twist into the styling.

In my spare time, focusing on making one of my first games using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Whack-a-mole.
The context of this game is that the player needs to hit the square that the mole is in as many times as possible until the time runs out. During the tutorial, the content that I have covered in JS are:

- document.querySelector
- textContent
- forEach
- addEventListener
- setInterval
- classList.add
